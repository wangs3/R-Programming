- R coding samples I wrote while taking the Coursera Data Science Specialization taught by Roger D. Peng, PhD, Jeff Leek, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD from JHU.

- The specialization contains 10 four-week courses:

1. The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox

2. R Programming

3. Getting and Cleaning Data

4. Exploratory Data Analysis

5. Reproducible Research

6. Statistical Inference

7. Regression Models

8. Practical Machine Learning

9. Developing Data Products

10. Data Science Capstone

I am currently doing 1. The Data Sciencetist's Toolbox and 2. R Programming

My expected finishing date of the specialization is Mid-March.
